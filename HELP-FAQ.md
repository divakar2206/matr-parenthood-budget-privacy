### How do I create an account or log in?
Open the app to see the authentication screen. You can:

- Use "Forgot Password" to request a reset email.

### What happens after I sign up or log in?
You’ll be taken to the Home screen/dashboard. On first signup, your account gets a default "user" role. All success/error messages appear as snackbars.

### What does the Home screen show?
Your dashboard gives you:
- An overview of your spending, budgets, and upcoming expenses.
- Quick access to add expenses, view checklists, budgets, and settings.

### What are the dashboard modes?
- **User Mode:** Most people see this—personal finance info, suggestions, upcoming expenses.
- **Admin Mode:** Extra tools for managing users/budgets if you’re an admin.

### How do I refresh my data?
Pull down on the dashboard to update your expenses, budgets, and reminders.

### How do I navigate?
Use the floating action button (FAB) for quick actions, or the side menu/drawer for navigation.

### What can I do in Budget Settings?
- View all months you’ve set a budget for.
- Edit a month’s budget by tapping it (changes are saved after validation).
- Add a budget for a single month or for a whole range of months.
- All changes are confirmed by popups/snackbars.

### Are there accessibility features?
Yes! All buttons and fields are screen-reader friendly and keyboard accessible. Color contrast and fonts follow accessibility best practices.

### What are Suggestions on my dashboard?
These cards alert you to things like:
- Overspending warnings
- Upcoming bills
- Progress on savings goals
- Unusual spending spikes

Tap a suggestion to get more details.

### What happens if something goes wrong?
Errors appear as popups or on-screen messages. Often, you’ll get options to retry or send feedback/report bugs right to the GitHub issues page.

### How do I give feedback or report an issue?
Use the "Feedback" option in error dialogs or visit the project’s GitHub issues page.

### What if my profile is incomplete?
