### **How do I create my first budget?**
To create your first budget:
1. Open the app and log in or sign up.
2. On the dashboard, tap the "+" (FAB) button.
3. Choose "Monthly Budget" or "Budget Overview" to start planning your budget.

### **What happens if my profile is incomplete after login?**
If your profile is missing required information (like your display name or due date), the app will redirect you to the profile setup screen for onboarding before you can use other features.
